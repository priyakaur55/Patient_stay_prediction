# Patient_stay_prediction

The length of stay (LOS) is a clinical measurement that
counts the time between a patientâ€™s hospital admission and
discharge. One of the most important uses of in-patient
stay prediction is to provide patients with tailored treatment
plans. Healthcare workers can change treatment plans to
offer the best possible care by anticipating how long a
patient will stay in the hospital. This method can result
in improved results and shorter hospital stays, lowering the
risk of hospital-acquired infections, reducing the strain on
the healthcare system, and optimizing hospital operations.
We used Random Forest and Decision tree to train the
model. With greater performance in categorizing positive
occurrences, the optimized decision tree had a test f1 score of
0.747 and the optimized random forest had a test F1 score of
0.76. For predicting unknowable data, the optimized random
forest was selected.
